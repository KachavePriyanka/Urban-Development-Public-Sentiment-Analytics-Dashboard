🎯 Project Overview 
This project is a Geospatial and Sentiment Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to function as an Evidence-Based Decision Support System for city planners. It unifies disparate municipal data streams with public feedback to optimize resource allocation and improve civic services.

⚠️ Problem Statement 
City management suffers from a data disconnect: key operational data (e.g., 311 requests, transit reports) is fragmented, and decision-making fails to integrate the real-time voice of the citizen. This leads to inefficient resource distribution and a low correlation between budget spend and actual public needs.
Weekly Breakdown
Week 1 – Data Integration & Geospatial Modeling
Cleaned and mapped 311 data
Integrated shapefiles into Power BI
Created heatmaps of complaint hotspots
Week 2 – Service Requests & Sentiment Analysis
Scraped and scored social media sentiment
Built dashboards for complaint types and resolution times
Overlaid sentiment data on complaint maps
Week 3 – Transit Performance & Sentiment Correlation
Visualized ridership and delays
Linked negative sentiment to transit issues
Used Key Influencers to identify drivers of dissatisfaction
Week 4 – Resource Allocation & Needs Analysis
Compared resource availability vs. complaint volume
Mapped underserved neighborhoods
Highlighted gaps in service coverage
Week 5 – Executive Summary Dashboard
Aggregated KPIs: complaints, sentiment, ridership
Visualized trends and resource gaps
Delivered a printable one-page report for stakeholders
📊 Key Insights
High complaint areas (Downtown, Midtown) lacked sufficient resources
Transit delays strongly correlated with negative sentiment
Uptown and SoHo were underserved despite high complaint volumes
✅ Recommendations
Prioritize high-complaint, low-resource neighborhoods
Improve transit reliability to boost public sentiment
Align resource allocation with real-time needs
