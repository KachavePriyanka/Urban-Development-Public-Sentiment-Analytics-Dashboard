🏙️ Urban Development & Public Sentiment Analytics Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Geospatial and Sentiment Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to function as an Evidence-Based Decision Support System for city planners. It unifies disparate municipal data streams with public feedback to optimize resource allocation and improve civic services.

❓ Problem Statement 
City management suffers from a data disconnect: key operational data (e.g., 311 requests, transit reports) is fragmented, and decision-making fails to integrate the real-time voice of the citizen. This leads to inefficient resource distribution and a low correlation between budget spend and actual public needs.


This project aims to:

Aggregate diverse urban datasets
Visualize problem hotspots
Correlate public sentiment with service performance
Enable data-driven decision-making

📆 Weekly Breakdown

Week 1 – Data Integration & Geospatial Modeling
Cleaned and mapped 311 data
Integrated shapefiles into Power BI
Created heatmaps of complaint hotspots

Week 2 – Service Requests & Sentiment Analysis
Scraped and scored social media sentiment
Built dashboards for complaint types and resolution times
Overlaid sentiment data on complaint maps

Week 3 – Transit Performance & Sentiment Correlation
Visualized ridership and delays
Linked negative sentiment to transit issues
Used Key Influencers to identify drivers of dissatisfaction

Week 4 – Resource Allocation & Needs Analysis
Compared resource availability vs. complaint volume
Mapped underserved neighborhoods
Highlighted gaps in service coverage

Week 5 – Executive Summary Dashboard
Aggregated KPIs: complaints, sentiment, ridership
Visualized trends and resource gaps
Delivered a printable one-page report for stakeholders

📊 Key Insights
High complaint areas (Downtown, Midtown) lacked sufficient resources
Transit delays strongly correlated with negative sentiment
Uptown and SoHo were underserved despite high complaint volumes

✅ Recommendations
Prioritize high-complaint, low-resource neighborhoods
Improve transit reliability to boost public sentiment
Align resource allocation with real-time needs

🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI: Dashboard development and data visualization
Azure Cognitive Services: Sentiment analysis
Python / Pandas: Data cleaning and preprocessing
Geospatial Mapping: Shapefile integration for spatial analysis

📄 Final Deliverables
Interactive Power BI dashboards

#. How To Use This Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.
Open the Urban Develo ment & Public Sentiment Dashboard file.
Explore the dashboards! All visuals are interactive.
(Important) Data Source Settings: The .pbix file is configured to look for the CSV files in a specific local path. Upon opening, you may need to update the data source settings in Power BI to point to the location of the /Data/ folder on your machine. This can be done via Transform data -> Data source settings.
